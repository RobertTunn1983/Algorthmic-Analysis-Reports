# Algorthmic-Analysis-Reports
Please note that I have not attached all of the results that I needed 
to generate for the creation for all charts in the report simply enough to 
demonstrate the experimental framework functions as described

In any event the parameters can easily be changed as for different ranges of
element integers the code can easily be amended at line 243 of MainApp where
the positive and negative range is set to (-50 to 50) as default
